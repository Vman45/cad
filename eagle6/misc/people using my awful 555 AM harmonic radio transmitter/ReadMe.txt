I have so much less respect for these organizations/websites now.
I see they will post articles about articles about electronics radios that are not designed properly.
Just goes to show that the internet is a echo chamber of people reposting other people's bullshit.
You really have to be skeptical.
Because people will write with authority about stuff that doesn't fucking work.
