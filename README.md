# JensenR30's Schematics and PCBs (printed circuit boards)

## kicad5

I am currently using KiCad 5 to draft schematics and create PCBs.


## kicad4

I used KiCad 4.0.6 for 3 weeks in September 2017. The two projects I completed are:

### SRBOB - Shift-Register Break-Out-Board
[kicad4/SRBOB](/kicad4/SRBOB)
A modular daisy-chain-able serial-in-parallel-out 74hc595-based shift register circuit board.

### XPhone/Input_Board
[kicad4/XPhone/Input_Board](/kicad4/XPhone/Input_Board
A quad transducer amplifier and glockenspiel-key-hit-detection circuit board.

## eagle6

Eagle was the first CAD program I ever used. I started using Eagle on version 5.11.0 sometime in early 2011. I stopped using Eagle on version 6.6.0 in 2017.
