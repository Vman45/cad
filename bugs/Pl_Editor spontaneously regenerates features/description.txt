Pl_Editor returns my page layout to default after I delete all the parts of it! This is not intuitive, and it does not seem right. This is a bug, plain and simple.

Steps to reproduce bug:
open KiCad
Tools -> Run Page Layout Editor (Ctrl + Y)
delete all of the features of the page (right click on rect1, press the 'D' key; right click on rect2, press the 'D' key; right click on segm1, press the 'D' key; ...)
Once you have deleted them all, the page will return to the default state (all of the features of the page will spontaneously return!!) But in the left-hand window, none of the features are displayed at first: picture for proof:
right before I delete the last part of the page: http://prntscr.com/fvgo23 (attachment 1)
right after  I delete the last part of the page: http://prntscr.com/fvgo7l (attachment 2)

Now, if I right click on "<default>" and select "Add line": http://prntscr.com/fvgoks (attachment 3)
All the features show up on the left-hand pane again: http://prntscr.com/fvgopo (attachment 4)

What I think should happen is this: when I delete all the features of the page, they STAY GONE. They should not reappear for no reason.


Thank you for taking the time to read my bug report  :)

Cheers!
