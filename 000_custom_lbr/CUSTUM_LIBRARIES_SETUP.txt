T0 use these custom eagle libraries, just drag and drop them into your eagle libraries directory.

To find this directory,
	open Eagle.exe
	click "Option" at the top of the window
	click "Directories..."
	Then look at the box that says "Libraries"
	If the box has "$EAGLEDIR\lbr" in it, then it will be in your eagle install directory.
	Check C:\Program Files (x86)\EAGLE-x.x.x\lbr\
	
Then just copy the files into this folder.


ALTERNATIVELY,
You can make a shortcut to my 000_custom_lbr folder, and put the schortcut (.lnk) in the libraries folder of Eagle.
Doing this will make it impossible to "Open Symbol" when in schematic view.
Eagle will tell you it cannot find the library for the part you are using, but everything else will work just fine.
